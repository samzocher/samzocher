# Research Interests 
### **Precision Medicine**

I am committed to using genomic, lifestyle, and environmental data in clinical care models to better inform treatment. My goal is to design ML interventions tailored to every patient

### **Social Determinants of Health and Health Disparities**

Incorporating SDOH data in a large-scale analysis can uncover gaps in care for certain populations. I will actively advocate for the inclusion of SDOH data to promote health equity.

### **Machine Learning/AI in Healthcare**

Many problems in healthcare can be tackled using AI or machine learning algorithms, helping to drive data-informed decisions. However, I am also aware of the risk these technologies pose when trained on non-representative datasets and keep ethical implications at the forefront of my work.
